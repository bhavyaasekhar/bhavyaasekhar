## 📌 Projects

### 🔹 [Statistical Data Analyzer](https://github.com/bhavyaasekhar/statistical-data-analyzer)
A command-line Python tool that uses only NumPy to:
- Calculate Mean, Median, Mode
- Variance & Standard Deviation
- Correlation Matrix
- Detect Outliers (Z-score & IQR)

> 💡 Demonstrates strong foundational data analysis skills using only NumPy — no pandas!

### 🔹 [Sales Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/bhavyaasekhar/sales_analysis_dashboard)
A beginner-friendly project analyzing a sales dataset using pandas and basic visualization. Extracted insights include:
- Monthly & Yearly Sales Trends  
- Top Products, Cities, and Customers  
- Region-wise & Category-wise analysis
